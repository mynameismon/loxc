#+TITLE: Crafting Interpreters

Following the excellent [[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]] book, this is an attempt to write a Lox interpreter in OCaML.

** Some goals
- Strong typing, or atleast, an attempt at hybrid typing, so I can use this to learn typing and type inference.
- Compile it instead of interpreting it
- Add optimisations
- Constant time operations to make it nice for cryptography?
